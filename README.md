# ys.icebreaker
Self interest development of a simple icebreaker app for ys, in conjunction with my desire to learn material design and angular-material directives.

This app uses:
 * jquery
 * angular
 * Materialize
 * angular-material
 * angular-ui-router
 * a0-angular-storage

Try it on your own machine:
 * npm install
 * bower install
 * gulp uglify

P.S. You will be needing an http server to run the app. Try downloading 'http-server' using npm.
